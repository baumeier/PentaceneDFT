# DFT And GW Calculations

## The DFT calculations
The succesfull dft calculations where done with the DFT code from Bjoerns PhD. The input files and data are on jcer2, they are either in `/home/bbaumeie/work/pentacene` or in `/home/ruben` and are labeled with `pentacene-GGA_+basis_*` where the asterix is replaced by the layer count of "bulk".
