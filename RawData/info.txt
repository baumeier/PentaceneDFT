Each of the ARRES images in the powerpoint is composed of three linecuts in the reciprocal space. The data of the linecuts can be found in the text files. 
The data is 2D. Each row corresponds to a certain energy, the columns correspond to intensities along the linecut at the corresponding energy.
The number of rows in the ARRES linecuts is 281, corresponding to energies in the range (-3,25) eV, with 0.1 eV increments.
The precise energies corresponding to the rows in the linecut texts can be found in ARRES_energies.npy

The last slide in the powerpoint is an IV curve of the (0,0) diffraction peak. It corresponds to a linecut in the ARRES images at the Gamma point.
This IV-curve, however, has somewhat more details than a linecut at Gamma point would give. But the shape of the curves is basically the same.
IV_energies.npy and IV_intensities.npy contain the data of the IV plot.
